CSS - Day 15
Answer the Following Questions
1.What is a media query in CSS, and why do we use them?
A.A media query in CSS is a rule that allows you to apply styles conditionally based on the characteristics of the device or browser window, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, or media type.
Why Do We Use Media Queries?
Media queries are essential for responsive web design, where websites adapt their layout and styling for different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Key reasons:

Responsive Design: Adjusts layout for different screen sizes.

Better User Experience: Provides optimized design for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.

Performance Optimization: Avoids unnecessary content on smaller devices.

Device-Specific Customization: Allows customizing styles for print, high-resolution displays, or landscape/portrait modes.
2.Explain the difference between min-width and max-width in media queries
A.min-width
Styles are applied when the viewport width is greater than or equal to the specified value.
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background: lightblue; /* Applied for width ≥ 768px */
  }
}
max-width
Styles are applied when the viewport width is less than or equal to the specified value.
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background: lightgreen; /* Applied for width ≤ 768px */
  }
}
3.What is the difference between screen, print, and all in media queries?
A.screen
Used for display screens like monitors, tablets, and mobile devices.

Most common for responsive web design.
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background: lightblue;
  }
}
print
Used when printing a webpage (e.g., when you hit Ctrl + P or Print Preview).

Helps create printer-friendly versions of web pages.
@media print {
  body {
    background: white;
    color: black;
    font-size: 12pt;
  }
  nav, footer {
    display: none; /* Hide navigation and footer when printing */
  }
}
all
Applies to all media types (both screen and print).

It's the default media type when no type is specified.

@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
4.What is the difference between em and px units in media queries?
A.px (Pixels)
Absolute unit.
1px = 1 device pixel (not scalable).

Breakpoints defined in px remain fixed, regardless of the user's font size settings or browser zoom.
em (Relative Unit)
Relative to the browser's default font-size.
Usually, 1em = 16px (if the default font size is 16px).

Breakpoints scale when the user changes the default font size in the browser settings, making them more accessible.
