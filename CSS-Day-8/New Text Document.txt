CSS - Day 8
Answer the Following Questions
1.What is Flexbox? Why would you use it over traditional float or inline-block layouts?
A.Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model used to create responsive, flexible layouts easily.

Why use Flexbox?
âœ… Easier alignment (center, space-between, etc.)
âœ… One-dimensional layout (works in a row or column)
âœ… Automatic spacing and sizing
âœ… No clearfix hacks like with floats
âœ… Better control over layout than inline-block or float
2.How does justify-content differ from align-items in a flex container?
A.justify-content:

Aligns items horizontally (main axis).

Example: justify-content: center; â†’ items centered left to right

align-items:

Aligns items vertically (cross axis).

Example: align-items: center; â†’ items centered top to bottom
3.Describe the difference between align-items and align-content. When does align-content have an effect?
A.align-items:

Aligns individual flex items along the cross axis.

Works even with one row of items.

align-content:

Aligns multiple rows/lines of flex items.

Only has an effect when there is wrapping (flex-wrap: wrap;) and multiple lines of items.
4.How do flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis affect the sizing of flex items?
A.flex-grow

Defines how much an item can grow relative to others.

Example: flex-grow: 1; â†’ item takes available space.

flex-shrink

Defines how much an item can shrink when space is tight.

Example: flex-shrink: 1; â†’ item shrinks if needed.

flex-basis

Sets the initial size of the item before grow/shrink.

Example: flex-basis: 100px; â†’ starts at 100px width.
5.What happens if you set min-width or max-width on flex items?
A.ðŸ”¹ min-width:
Prevents the item from shrinking below a certain width, even if flex-shrink allows shrinking.

ðŸ”¹ max-width:
Prevents the item from growing beyond a certain width, even if flex-grow allows growing.
6.Can you nest flex containers? What are some caveats?
A.
7.How would you vertically and horizontally center a div using Flexbox?
A.To vertically and horizontally center a <div> using Flexbox, apply these styles to its parent container:
8.What is the effect of flex-wrap: wrap on a flex container?
A.flex-wrap: wrap allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines if there's not enough space in one line.

Without wrap (flex-wrap: nowrap; â€“ default):
All items stay on one line and shrink if needed.

With wrap (flex-wrap: wrap;):
Items move to the next line instead of shrinking too small.
