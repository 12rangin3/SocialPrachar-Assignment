CSS - Day 4
Answer the Following Questions
1.Explain the difference between block, inline, and inline-block properties
A.Block:
Takes full width, starts on a new line.
Example: <div>, <p>

Inline:
Takes only as much width as needed, does not start on a new line.
Example: <span>, <a>

Inline-block:
Like inline (stays in line), but allows setting width and height.
Example: Used for buttons or custom layout elements.
2.What is box-shadow? How to apply it?
A.Box-shadow adds shadow effects around an element's box.

Syntax:

box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur-radius color;
Example:

box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px gray;
Meaning:

2px: horizontal offset

2px: vertical offset

5px: blur radius

gray: shadow color

3.What happens if you set a negative margin?
A.If you set a negative margin in CSS, the element pulls closer to its neighboring elements:

Negative top margin: pulls the element up.

Negative bottom margin: pulls the element down over the next element.

Negative left/right margin: pulls the element left/right, possibly overlapping others.

It's useful for fine layout adjustments but can break design if misused.
4.What is border-radius? How to create a circle with it?
A.Border-radius in CSS is used to make rounded corners.

Syntax:
border-radius: value;
To create a circle:
Make the element a square and set border-radius: 50%.

Example:
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
border-radius: 50%;
This creates a perfect circle.
5.What is display: none vs visibility: hidden?
A.display: none

Completely removes the element from the layout.

No space is reserved.

visibility: hidden

Hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
