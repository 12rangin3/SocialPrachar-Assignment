CSS - Day 5
Answer the Following Questions:
1.Explain the difference between position: relative and position: absolute.
A.position: relative positions the element relative to its normal position.

position: absolute positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

Key Difference:
relative: keeps space in the document flow.

absolute: removes the element from the flow.
2.What is the stacking context? How does z-index work with positioned elements?
A.Stacking context is the 3D layer system of elements on a webpage. It determines which elements appear in front or behind others.

How z-index works:
z-index only works on positioned elements (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky).

Higher z-index = element appears on top.
3.What is the difference between position: fixed and sticky?
A.
position: fixed:

Stays fixed to the viewport (screen), even when scrolling.

Doesn't move with the page.

Removed from normal document flow.

position: sticky:

Acts like relative until a scroll threshold is met, then it sticks in place.

Scrolls with the page until it "sticks".

Needs a top, left, etc., value to work.

Example:
fixed: Navbar always visible on top.

sticky: Header stays at top only while scrolling its section
