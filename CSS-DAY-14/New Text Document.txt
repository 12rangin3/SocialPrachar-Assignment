CSS - Day 14
Answer the Following Questions
1.What is the difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?
a.Pseudo-classes (:)
Describe a special state of an element.
Example:a:hover { color: red; } /* Styles a link when hovered */
Pseudo-elements (::)
Select and style a part of an element, like the first line, first letter, or a virtual element (before/after content).
Example:p::first-line { font-weight: bold; }

2.What’s the difference between :first-child and :nth-child(1)?
a.:first-child
Selects the element if it is the first child of its parent.
p:first-child { color: blue; }
:nth-child(1)
Selects the first element of its parent, regardless of type (same as :first-child).
p:nth-child(1) { color: blue; }
3.Explain :not() vs :where() — how do they affect specificity?
A.:not(selector)
Excludes elements that match the selector. Its specificity is equal to the selector inside.
div:not(.highlight) { color: black; }
:where(selector)
Works like :not(), but it adds zero specificity regardless of the selector inside.
:where(section p) { margin: 0; } /* 0 specificity */

4.What problem does :is() solve? Give a real‑world selector example.
A.:is() allows you to group selectors without repeating the parent. It takes the highest specificity of its arguments.
article h1, article h2, article h3 { color: red; }
article :is(h1, h2, h3) { color: red; }
5.What’s the difference between :focus, :focus-visible, and :focus-within?
A.:focus
Styles an element when it is focused (clicked or tabbed into).
input:focus { border: 2px solid blue; }
:focus-visible
Styles elements only when focus is visible (keyboard users), avoiding unwanted outlines for mouse clicks.
input:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid orange; }
:focus-within
Styles a parent if any of its children are focused.
form:focus-within { background: #f5f5f5; }
6.Why do we need content when using ::before and ::after?
A.::after?
::before and ::after create generated content, which doesn’t exist in the HTML.

content is required to render them, even if empty:
button::before { content: ""; display: block; }
7.What’s the difference between ::first-line and ::first-letter?
A.::first-line
Styles the first line of text in a block.
p::first-line { font-weight: bold; }
::first-letter
Styles only the first letter of the block.
p::first-letter { font-size: 2em; }
8.What does ::selection style? What are its limitations?
A.::selection styles the portion of text highlighted by the user (when you drag the mouse to select text).
p::selection { background: yellow; color: black; }
9.Explain ::marker — what elements can it style?
A.::marker styles the bullet or numbering of list items.
li::marker { color: red; font-size: 1.5em; }

10.What’s the difference between [attr], [attr="value"], and [attr^="val"]?
A.[attr]
Selects elements that have the attribute, regardless of value.
[title] { color: green; }
[attr="value"]
Selects elements where the attribute exactly matches the value.
[type="text"] { border: 1px solid blue; }
[attr^="val"]
Selects elements where the attribute value starts with "val".
[class^="btn"] { padding: 10px; }
